                    <h2>My Second Year College Trauma</h2>

                    <p class="blog-para">What is a day in the life of a second year student living on hall? I might add as well, a day where nothing goes wrong.
                        An average day in second year includes snoozing all alarm clocks, overthinking while brushing, arriving to class completely exhausted even
                        though it is just 9:00 am. Almost all conversations among friends were academic, and lasted a brief minute or two. It seemed to have taken
                        a mental toll on everyone. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, but risking to play can make Jack an even more dull boy. There came a time
                        when we realized the issue was with strategizing. My hardest courses were Discrete Mathematics and Net Centric Computing. Discrete was a course that tested your stamina
                        and sharpness, how quick we can formulate solutions that are meaningful, if not, at least fully correct. Net Centric threw heavy theory, numbers and formulas down our way.<br><br>

                        Second year can be bearable if you stick with friends who match your vibe, that is, strategize on questions and prioritize with deadlines, similar to you. Some lessons I learned were:
                        it is normal not to understand everything in a lecture, tutorials are important - even more important in weeks where the lecture was overwhelming or you missed it,
                        you do not have to do everything in one day, you should not leave everything for the last day and most importantly, speak up because tuition is a privilege, as much
                        as it is a service. In the end, everything worked out to be just fine.

                    <h2>Never Hiking Again?</h2>
                    <h4>September 30, 2024 by Vedang Kevlani</h4>
                    <img class="blog-two-image" src="hike.jpg" alt="image of hiking">
                    <p class="blog-para">My camera roll tells me that it was either May 10 or May 11 of this year, that my friend and I went on a hike to Blue Mountains for the first time.
                        Both of us were inexperienced hikers, so we went with a tour guide. The journey began from a point in St. Andrew, where only offroad vehicles can ascend. Mavis Bank was the name.
                        From Mavis Bank to at least half the ascent of Blue Mountain, it is possible to go with an offroad vehicle. The hike really begins from Jacob's Ladder, and we started at 8 am.
                        There were times we felt that the tour guide was either far ahead of us or far behind us to hear our voices. With aimless steps and a strong spirit, we were able to finally reach a rest stop at 10 am.
                        That point is known as Portland Gap. We rested for about 35 minutes before climbing again. It does not sound difficult yet, does it?<br><br>

                        The hardest part of the hike is the second leg, where temperatures can drop, obviously very low, which may cause problems for someone like me, with altitude sickness. I forced myself to 3/4 of the hike, to the peak.
                        This was when I gave out and sat on a rock pertruding in our path. Fortunately, there was cellular signal at such a height. My friend got to explore the peak, which made me realize that for that specific 
                        day, it is good that I did not go further - everything was foggy. It began raining, and coming down now was harder than going up. I fell twice as it was slippery, and by time we arrived at the vehicle it was almost twilight.
                        My legs were sore and aching, my throat was dry for the rest of the night. However, I made it a mission to go home, and I recovered successfully within a few days. Will I ever do it again? Maybe. Maybe not.
